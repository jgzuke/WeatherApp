I used LoganSquare to parse the json response because it is incredibly fast and allows extra parameters to very easily be added to the model.

I chose to use https://github.com/pwittchen/WeatherIconView for the icons, because it allowed icons to be easily replaced or added for new conditions, and I didnt't like the default ones from the openweather api.
